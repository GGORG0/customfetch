[config]
# customfetch is designed with customizability in mind
# here is how it works:
# the variable "layout" is used for showing the infos
# as like as the user want, no limitation.
# inside here there are 5 "tags": $<> $() ${} $[] $%%

# The Info tag $<> lets you print the value of a member of a module.
# e.g $<user.name> will print the username, $<os.kernel_version> will print the kernel version and so on.
# All the modules and their members are listed in the `--list-modules` argument

# The Bash command tag $() will execute bash commands and print the output.
# e.g $(echo \"hello world\") will indeed echo out hello world.
# you can even use pipes
# e.g $(echo \"hello world\" | cut -d' ' -f2) will only print world

# The Conditional tag $[] is used to display different outputs based on the comparison.
# syntax MUST be $[something,equalToSomethingElse,iftrue,ifalse]
# note: putting spaces between commas, could change the expected result
#
# Each part can have a tag or anything else.
# e.g $[$<user.name>,$(echo $USER),the name is correct,the name is NOT correct]
# This is useful when on some terminal or WM the detection can be different than others

# The Color tag ${} is used for printing the text of a certain color.
# e.g "${red}hello world" will indeed print "hello world" in red (or the color you set in the variable)
# The colors can be predefined such as: black, red, green, blue, cyan, yellow, magenta, white.
# They can be configured in the config file.
#
# They can have hexcodes colors (e.g "#5522dd").
# You can apply special effects to colors by using the following symbols before the '#' in hex codes:
# * b  for background color.
# * u  for underline the text
# * !  for bold text
# * i  for italic text
#
# Alternatively, ANSI escape codes can be used, e.g ${\e[1;32m} or ${\e[0;34m}.
# NOTE: 256-color ANSI escape codes (those that starts with \\[38 or \\[48) cannot be used in GUI mode.
#
# To reset colors, use ${0} for a full reset or ${1} for a bold reset.
#
# To use the colors that the ascii art logo uses, use ${auto} for getting the 1st color, ${auto4} for the 4th one and so on.
# If you're using GUI mode and wants to display a custom source that's an image, all the auto colors will be the same colors as the distro ones

# The Percentage tag $%% is used for displaying the percentage between 2 numbers.\
# It **Must** contain a comma for separating the 2. They can be either be taken from a tag or it put yourself.\
# For example: $%50,100%
# For inverting colors of bad and great (red and green), before the last '%' put '!'
# without quotes ofc

# Little FAQ
# Q: "Why when I use something like "$<os.kernel> <- Kernel" it won't work on GUI mode?"
# A: replace "<-" with "\\<-". It won't affect the printing in terminal

# Inspired by nitch default config
# and this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/1eedqnm/gnome_clean_daily_driver/
