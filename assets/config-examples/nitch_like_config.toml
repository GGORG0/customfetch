# customfetch is designed with customizability in mind
# here is how it works:
# the variable "layout" is used for showing the infos
# as like as the user want, no limitation.
# inside here there are 3 "components": $<> $() ${}

# $<> lets you access a member of a module
# e.g $<user.name> will print the username, $<os.kernel_version> will print the kernel version and so on.
# run "cufetch -l" for a list of builti-in modules

# $() let's you execute bash commands
# e.g $(echo \"hello world\") will indeed echo out Hello world.
# you can even use pipes
# e.g $(echo \"hello world\" | cut -d' ' -f2) will only print world

# ${} is used for which color to use for colorizing the text
# e.g "${red}hello world" will indeed print "hello world" in red (or the color you set in the variable)
# you can even put a custom hex color e.g: ${#ff6622} (for bold text put ! before # e.g ${!#ff6622} )
# OR bash escape code colors e.g ${\e[1;32m} or ${\e[0;34m}.
# For auto coloring, depending on the ascii logo colors, use ${auto}.
# They can be used for different colors too. So for getting the 2nd color of the ascii logo,
# use ${auto2}, for the 4th one use ${auto4} and so on.

# Little FAQ
# Q: "but then if I want to make only some words/chars in a color and the rest normal?"
# A: there is ${0}. e.g "${red}hello ${0}world, yet again" will only print "hello" in red, and then "world, yet again" normal
#    Or, if you want to reset color and make it bold, use ${1}
